      "{('YBN Cordae', 'The Lost Boy'): 'The YBN Crew’s origin story is already the stuff of internet legend, even though the group formed just five years ago. Nick Simmons was born in Birmingham and met Jay Bradley, of Galveston, while playing Grand Theft Auto V. They bonded out of a shared love of rap music and live-streaming video games, eventually recording  their first freestyles in XBOX Live group chats as YBN Nahmir and YBN Almighty Jay, respectively.In 2017, Nahmir and YBN Glizzy met Cordae Amari Dunston online, and Dunston immediately became the elder statesman of the crew. While the group found viral success with Nahmir’s “Rubbin Off the Paint,” the vision they presented on last year’s YBN: the Mixtape was that of a three-headed monster led by Cordae.With The Lost Boy, Cordae makes good on the promise hinted at on YBN: The Mixtape, turning in a front-to-back redemption tale. It is Cordae at his most humble. It’s occasionally corny and self-serious. But its 15 tracks show a star slowly finding his voice and bursting into the mainstream.Through this lens, the Chance the Rapper-assisted “Bad Idea” makes sense on multiple levels. Over an interpolation of Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway’s “Be Real Black For Me,” Cordae takes cues from Chance on the chorus, cooing “Don’t you cry/It’ll be alright.” It’s a ghost-of-Christmas-past tale: Cordae imagines what it would be like to never come home again, the adoring family members he would never see. There’s strength in community, he seems to be saying, and it’s a message that permeates the record.On first single “Have Mercy,” Cordae turns his gaze outward. Over a “Mask Off”-inspired flute sample and 808, Cordae begins, “Sweet lord please have mercy/Baby Jesus please save us.” It’s a call to join, and in the hands of a less-deft rapper, this sort of proselytizing would come off as saccharine at best, invasive at worst. But Cordae seems to come only from a place of appreciation, bursting with joy at a newfound life that formerly looked bleak.The Lost Boy splits its time between thankfulness and victory laps. On “RNP,” Cordae basks in the glow of success over a sermonizing Anderson .Paak chorus and bouncy J. Cole production: “Smiling ‘cause I’m young, rich, black, and I’m handsome/Not to mention wealthy/Ass on the healthy.” It is, undoubtedly, a dumb line, and the track is one of the record’s clear misses, mistaking puns for cleverness and energy for quality.On the flip side, he sounds surprisingly assured next to Pusha-T on “Nightmares Are Real.” He goes toe-to-toe with the veteran, even encouraging Push to find grace in the building blocks of his career: “I can tell you how I started in this rap shit/Eighth grade backflipping on a mattress.”Despite the glossy guestlist, The Lost Boy remains Cordae’s show. At 15 songs, it could have used an edit, another voice in the room telling him to tone it down. But still, it’s an assured debut. Cordae raps about life with the patience of a pro but the wide-eyed wonder of a newborn. It’s a delicate balance, and he occasionally stumbles, but it’s promising to even watch him try.', ('Caleb Giles', 'Under the Shade'): 'For a while, it seemed like every rapper coming out of the five boroughs was a retro revivalist, tethered to the greats of the past, like a rookie NBA player pulling on the jersey of a legacy team. But young guys like MIKE, Medhane, Adé Hakim (formerly known as Sixpress), and Slauson Malone reside in a New York City where Earl Sweatshirt is a more powerful god than Chuck D. These rappers have run an insurgency campaign on the local scene, contorting elements of classic East Coast hip-hop into their own warped vision for the future.Enter Caleb Giles. On his third album Under the Shade, the 21-year-old Bronx native engages with some core tenets of the classic New York sound—dusty samples, deep-thinking lyricism, soulful attitude—but with a bitter streak as cold as a winter ride on the top deck of the NYC Ferry. Countering the icy atmospherics, Giles’ flow is clean and youthful, his writing is resonant, and he has a way with a pleasing chorus. It adds up to a set that unites past and present more clearly than any of his contemporaries, adding a distinct ripple to this new surge of regional inventiveness.Giles’s burgeoning rap career comes with an interesting peg: he also plays saxophone in Standing on the Corner, the jazz ensemble with credits on both Earl and Solange records. Yet Under the Shade never indulges in the freewheeling jazz meditations you might expect. Sure, there’s a decaying old trumpet here, a stoned bassline there. But they help form a neatly clipped set of percolating beats that compliment Giles’s plainspoken flows.Under the dim light, Giles comes off as a burdened young man. He laments missed opportunities and describes poverty with grim clarity. Rap usually locates poverty comfortably in the past, but Giles wants you to know all about his present-day struggles. On the 50-second “Gather,” he lays out a pretty basic wishlist: He wants a car that runs, to hold down a job, and to simply have $100 in his pocket.It’s fair to say that Under the Shade is a good start, not a defining statement. At 24 minutes, it’s over too quickly, with shorter cuts like “Gather” and “Syl’s Song” begging to be developed into full-bodied songs. And as a rapper, Giles lacks a force of personality to match his nuanced lyrics. But Under the Shade excites anyway, another welcome shot in the arm for contemporary New York rap.', ('Iggy Azalea', 'In My Defense'): 'Iggy Azalea wants you to know she’s not sorry. She mentions this on every track of her new album, braiding it into brags about her money and her body until they snarl together in a petty wreath. It’s an odd package for a record with high stakes: This is her first album in five years, after her planned 2016 release Digital Distortion was shelved, and the first she’s released on her independent label. In those years, she has cemented a reputation built on appropriation and controversy. Name a major artist—Halsey, Snoop Dogg, the cartoon character Peppa Pig—and Iggy has entangled herself in some sort of feud with them. On an album with the unsubtle title In My Defense, she attempts to cast herself as a victim while further distorting and dismissing the cultures she takes from. Less than three minutes into the album, she raps, “Because I talk like this and my ass fat/They be saying Iggy tryna act black.” A few tracks later, she drops the record’s thesis: “I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit.”Didn’t we cancel Iggy Azalea? Maybe because of the nature of the internet, or because of the privilege that Iggy both willfully ignores and has worn as a shield throughout her career, she’s somewhat positioned for a comeback; media outlets have been hinting at her potential victorious return for years. This album could have been an opportunity to show an ounce of contrition, to own up to her mistakes and demonstrate that she has learned. Iggy is talented: a four-time Grammy nominee with the vocal toolkit and dancefloor command that allowed her to jump on and invigorate hits. (On “Fancy,” she handily eclipsed Charli XCX, a feat that few of Charli’s collaborators have managed.) But talent isn’t an excuse, and on this album, it’s almost irrelevant.“I just knew I wanted to go to America and be a rapper and have a ponytail and a leopard-skin jacket that went down to my feet, and like, 20 white, fluffy dogs on one leash,” she told Dazed and Confused in 2012. The album is stacked with cartoonish approximations of what she thinks a rap song should sound like: shivers of bass, the occasional “skrrrt,” Mad Libs of designer brands and bodily fluids. Many sound like direct imitations of the rappers she admires. “Sally Walker,” the best song on the album, features sparkling piano chords similar to Cardi B’s “Money” (J. White produced both songs). The exhausting, Juicy J-featuring “Freak of the Week” sounds like a rejected track by Megan Thee Stallion, whose debut album features her own song with the Memphis rapper. She hisses “lil’ bitch” in a way that sounds like Rico Nasty.It’s possible Iggy sees herself as a pioneer who paved the way for female rappers. Her album starts with “Thanks I Get,” a paltry diatribe about the “little mes” she claims to see. Women have been rapping as well as men for as long as rap has existed, but it’s only now, years after Iggy came on the scene, that they seem to be inching towards getting equal attention. Iggy Azalea is not the only current rapper who fills songs with dreary, monotonous references to sex and money, but many find creative, amusing, and even raw ways to write and spit about both. Instead, Iggy crams her songs with one-liners that sound like branded Instagram captions: “I waste my wine before I ever waste my time”; “Catch flights not feelings.” Even worse are the banal repetitions: “I just wanna nut,” she whispers over a bastardized “Push It” sample, subjecting us to the word “nut” 15 times in under three minutes. Mixed metaphors wilt over predictable beats. I found myself bobbing along automatically to the slumped synths and handclaps, then wanting to hit “next” after 30 seconds of each song.For an album so concerned about “haters,” the worst we see comes from Iggy herself. “They call me racist/Only thing I like is green and blue faces,” she sneers, managing to corrode and embarrass herself in one line. Rather than penitence, she offers only a garish caricature. Her only defense is to further offend.', ('Nas', 'The Lost Tapes 2'): 'In February 1999, just before the mp3 era reached its peak, 13 tracks from Nas’ forthcoming double LP I Am....The Autobiography leaked onto the internet. With the core of the album in the wild almost two months before the scheduled release date, Nas and his team at Columbia panicked, scrapping the original tracklist and pushing back the album release date.I Am....The Autobiography was intended as a concept double-album, with one disc recounting his life from birth to death by suicide and the second dedicated to his afterlife. The leak blew up that grand scheme, and the album was officially released as the haphazardly assembled single-disc I Am, without most of the leaked songs. Some would be released as part of the career nadir that was late ’99’s Nastradamus, but the rest circulated for years in varying fidelity, creating an aura of mystique around these “lost” tracks. When they finally saw an official release in 2002 as The Lost Tapes, it solidified the resurgence sparked by 2001’s Stillmatic and the legendary beef with JAY-Z.But The Lost Tapes 2 is a sequel in name only. Originally meant for a 2003 release, the project was delayed by his signing with Def Jam and their subsequent disagreements, and it’s unlikely this compilation is the same as the one he intended to release back then. Miles away from the leaked gems on The Lost Tapes—considered some of Nas’ best work—this sequel comprises detritus from the last decade or so of Nas’ storied career.Even if the lows of Nas’ post-millennium output have been plagued by corny hooks and questionable beat selection, his failures were often in the service of experimentation—or in the case of Nastradamus, a rushed production process—and he’s never lacked access to the game’s premier production talents. The credits for The Lost Tapes 2 reads like a hip-hop all-star team: Swizz Beatz, Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, No I.D., RZA, Hit-Boy, Eric Hudson, DJ Dahi, Pete Rock, and the Alchemist are all featured. And there are indeed some highlights: The Swizz Beatz-produced “No Bad Energy,” a moody slow-burner washed in atmospheric background vocals that suits his wistful nostalgia, the crunchy lo-fi wizardry of RZA’s “Highly Favored,” or the vintage Queens boom-bap of Pete Rock’s standout “Queensbridge Politics,” in which Nas plays the wise old uncle, at his most comfortable and confident.But it’s tragic to hear what he’s done with some of these productions. For much of the record, Nas sounds like he’s trying too hard. “It Never Ends” is a swirling piano beat from Alchemist primed for a laid back flow that Nas...inexplicably yells over, biting The Notorious B.I.G.’s infamous “Seven Mac-11’s…” line in what appears to be a tribute. This mismatched energy is also apparent on a perfectly serviceable beat from Pete Rock (“The Art of It”), in which Nas sandwiches a single decent verse (“Pulled out the barrel/Four-fifths rip through bone marrow/Make his toes spiral the dirt/While his feet kick up rock, he’s a sprinter”) in between two head-shakers (“A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega/British Knights sneaker...” and so on through the alphabet). “Beautiful Life,” his most direct reference to his divorce from the singer Kelis, offers no real clarity to their mutual allegations of abuse, and its celebratory tone leaves a stale aftertaste. Like most of the songs on Lost Tapes 2, it never should have seen the light of day, a sentiment that was, at one point, shared by Nas himself. That he would release an album that didn’t even meet his own standards is dispiriting.', ('Mase', 'Harlem World'): 'Mase floats skyward wearing golden goggles and a shiny suit that looks like a tricked-out air traffic control vest. His rise through an ultramodern wind tunnel feels remarkably symbolic as Kelly Price lip-syncs Diana Ross’ “I’m Coming Out” on a monitor behind him. He’s wearing the same diamond-studded Jesus piece the Notorious B.I.G. had on when he was murdered. As he swaggers through the futuristic Hype Williams-directed music video for 1997’s “Mo Money, Mo Problems,” histories are being rewritten in real-time; the nature of rap as an epic retail commodity is growing. It is a eulogy and a coronation all at once. It is Bad Boy rising from the ashes.This was how Sean “Puffy” Combs, marketing extraordinaire, formally introduced a rebranded Mason Betha to the world. Despite guest starring on a No. 1 single months prior, this was Mase’s coming out party, the official induction of Bad Boy’s next star. For several years, Betha had been a foot soldier on the insular Harlem rap scene snarling about returning fire in shootouts, infrared beams, and slug-filled foes coughing up blood. Now he was nearly nonchalant, rapping about Dolce tube socks and putting his name on blimps. The transformation into a flashy ladykiller was Puff’s idea. “I was Murda, P. Diddy made me pretty,” Mase joked on a song called “Lookin’ at Me.”The transformation worked brilliantly and made Mase and Puff arguably more popular than any rappers before them, but it also raised questions about the value of style over substance among a classicist rap community that had just lost two icons to gun violence, the first Tupac Shakur, the other in their own camp. Puff, the man who’d brought hip-hop Biggie Smalls, one of its greatest ever rappers, was suddenly being pegged as an arbiter of bad taste, with Mase his steward in flamboyant emptiness. Initially seen as a sycophant riding Puff’s coattails, and then as an unworthy successor to Biggie, Mase was nearly defiant in his self-belief: “You don’t like me? Bet against me,” he rapped casually on “Niggaz Wanna Act.” That effortless confidence and poise defines his debut album, Harlem World, one of the best rap albums to be almost shamelessly commercial. It was the peak of the shiny suit era, sparking the short-lived jiggy rap phenomenon of the late ’90s.Mason Bethea was a New Yorker born in the South. Perhaps that’s why he seemed to do everything on his own time, why he talked slower than the big city rappers he grew up with. The youngest of six children, he was delivered almost two months early in Jacksonville, Florida, and he and his mother fled an abusive father, showing up unannounced to live with an uncle in Harlem. Unscheduled arrivals became a hallmark of his life. “I guess from the very beginning I was coming onto the scene before people were ready to see me,” he says in his 2001 pseudo memoir, Revelations: There’s a Light After the Lime. After leading the basketball team to the PSAL Finals his senior year at Manhattan Center High School, Betha and teammate Cameron Giles had dreams of going to the NBA, but when Betha was forced to repeat his senior year—which meant a year without playing ball—the friends picked up rap as a hobby. From the beginning, they were opposites. Cam was the fire; Mase was preternaturally chill.As amateur rappers in Harlem going by Killa Cam and Murda Mase, the two immersed themselves in the corner scene, rapping around town at gambling spots and after games at Rucker Park. They joined a rap crew called Children of the Corn, founded in 1993 by a far more serious Harlem rapper named Big L. They were managed by an assertive Manhattan Center student named Damon Dash, but he was really courting L, who was known around town as the best rapper in the borough. (Some years later, Dame’s Roc-A-Fella Records would chase Big L again until his death in 1999.) The crew was primarily rapping about being young and menacing with Mase playing the coolest head. Cam was all action (“I’m a cat with nine lives but every day I risk em.”) Big L was the first in the group to catch a break when his Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous single “M.V.P.” started gaining traction in New York. But a few months later, the Notorious B.I.G. released a “One More Chance” remix with the same DeBarge sample and all but killed L’s momentum. As Big L’s major career sputtered, Murda Mase kept rapping on 139th and Lenox, in front of a 24-hour chicken spot. It was a connection to Biggie that would soon give him his chance to become Harlem’s biggest star.Betha’s twin sister introduced him to Cudda Love, Biggie’s road manager, in 1996. After hearing a Murda Mase tape, Cudda went up to SUNY Purchase, where Betha was going to school, to inquire about his level of commitment to rap. “‘I already know you’re nice,’” Mase remembers him saying, “‘I just need to know if you want to make money?’” The relationship started paying dividends almost immediately. After only a few weeks, Cudda took Betha to audition for Biggie on a freezing New York City sidewalk out front of the Apollo theater. Biggie was impressed and wanted to put Murda Mase in the newly debuted Brooklyn group Junior M.A.F.I.A., but Cudda had other ideas: he sold his Acura to buy a pair of plane tickets to Atlanta for the colossal annual rap convention, Jack the Rapper’s Family Affair. Mase was so broke at the time that he was sharing a one-bedroom apartment and splitting White Castle burgers, but Cudda, knowing the man needed to look the part, let Mase borrow a silk Versace shirt with flamboyant colors, and Mase spent his last dime on Versace pants and shoes to complete the look. “Somebody’s going to notice me,” he remembers thinking.The convention afterparty was at the Hard Rock, and when he failed to woo producer Jermaine Dupri outside the venue, Cudda finagled an opportunity for Betha to try and impress Puff on the dancefloor. “You rap like that all the time? That slow?” Mase remembers Puff asking him, intrigued. “I liked his style,” Combs told the Los Angeles Times in 1997. “His personality stood out. The sound of his voice. He sounded like me.” When Mase got back to New York, he was Bad Boy. Only a few weeks later, he was reunited with Biggie, this time as teammates, on the “Only You” remix. There was a dollar sign in his name now. Puff showed him the money (allegedly $250,000, $50k upfront, outbidding Heavy D at Uptown Records, Tommy Boy Records, and his old friend Dame Dash at Roc-A-Fella) and he planned to make good on his investment. “I’m the newest member of the Bad Boy team/And I’ma bring this nigga Puff mad more cream,” Mase pledged on “Take What’s Yours.” “With hooks galore, leave the city shook for sure/And I’ma take ‘em back where Biggie took ‘em before.”Mase quickly made good on his promise. Puff was anxious to put his talents to use across the Bad Boy roster, and basically every record they cut together from 1996 to the summer of ‘97 hit. In the wake of Biggie’s death in March of 1997, Mase was suddenly thrust into a new role as replacement headliner. He was constantly fielding questions about inheriting the Bad Boy throne. His response was to turn that throne into a recliner. The album was wholly self-aware; chock full of jams and conscious of it. Mase wanted to take his insular Harlem world global, and he did, rolling out a red carpet from Lenox Ave. into suburban households across the country.Harlem World is larger than life. Mase had a buttery touch when in his groove, as if having an out-of-body experience watching himself churn out hits. “Why do what most do? Do what you ’posed to/Make hot jams y’all, sell bicoastal/If you want a hit you can let me coach you/Money back on anything that got my vocals,” he rapped on rhetorical opener “Do You Wanna Get $?” And while it’s safe to say Puff Daddy wasn’t a good rapper and was, in fact, simply just an executive masquerading as a showman, no such claim could be made about Mase. His flows were as silky, or as plush, or as golden as the material world furnishing his songs. He made the realm of luxury feel quaint.Part of the credit is owed to Puff, his ace in-house production team the Hitmen, and other rising beatmakers like the Neptunes, Dame Grease, and Jermaine Dupri who, to paraphrase Combs on the uber-jiggy “Feel So Good,” flipped hits from the ’80s and made ’em sound so crazy. They spun Isaac Hayes, Teena Marie, New Edition, Curtis Mayfield, and Michael Jackson into satiny soundbeds Mase would sprawl out in. Talk of Puff during the late ’90s often found a way back to Berry Gordy shaping the sound of Motown; the Bad Boy exec had a similar genius for putting everyone in a position to succeed. No Way Out remains his crowning achievement as a producer, but across Harlem World he makes Mase look like rap Hugh Hefner.Mase was underrated in his ability to make extravagant things seem quotidian. He had TVs in the headrests of his red Lex years before Xzibit was kitting out cars on “Pimp My Ride.” He preferred his money in yen because the Japanese didn’t tax him, and if you had something to ask him you could send him a fax. Rappers had been rich before but they’d rarely been thriftless. Mase was Scrooge McDuck diving into a vault of coins and finding his wealth exhausting. “It’s like y’all be talkin’ funny/I don’t understand the language of people with short money,” he rapped on “Feel So Good” over a Kool & the Gang sample that sounded like strolling the Las Vegas Strip at night. To listen to his music was to be vicariously untouchable.But Harlem World was wrongly depicted as lyrically limited and uninvolved, as well as far removed from the street rap deemed of and for the culture, emblematic of a transitional period when rap’s reach had, to the disdain of some hardcore fans, become a “Seinfeld” joke. It was too above ground, too kitsch, too expensive. The album was often ostentatious, to be sure, largely materialistic and definitely profit-oriented, but certainly not without its hood charms and never unaware of where it came from. Mase’s raps weren’t dense or heavy with double-entendre, but there was plenty of subtly tricky rapping worked into his flexible cadences. And for all the talk of excess, Mase pulled grit and grind rappers like DMX, 8Ball, and MJG into his orbit, made space for the shriek raps of Busta Rhymes, and matched the finesse of early mafioso JAY-Z. He was just as likely to shit talk as he was to flex. Everything circled back to the ubiquity he’d achieved as a Bad Boy poster child, but it still all began with Murda in Harlem.Almost overnight, Mase set up shop on the Billboard charts as if it was a label requirement. From Biggie’s death through the summer of 1998, all Mase did was make hit records: After handing Puff No. 1 and No. 2 smash hits, “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” and “Been Around the World,” respectively, and then bringing things to a head with his zeitgeist-shifting appearance on “Mo Money, Mo Problems,” Harlem World produced three Top 10 singles of its own. The album, which hit stores in October, was double platinum by December. He collected four plaques from the RIAA and was nominated for the same Grammy twice. The only rappers who had bigger years than he did were … Biggie and Puff.The short-lived Jiggy Rap Era—which included Jay-Z’s In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, peaked with Will Smith’s Big Willie Style, and concluded with the rise of DMX in 1998—has been primarily remembered with contempt, along with the Ringtone Rap that would take hold a decade later. But Harlem World remains the sleekest rap album about becoming super famous. It set precedents for decades of posh rap consumerism. It is flagrantly commodified, proud of it, but not lesser for it.Somewhere along the line, Mase grew weary of the fame, which was reflected in his music. He lost his love for rap and retired live on Hot 97 weeks before the release of his 1999 sophomore album Double Up. He became a pastor. He briefly returned to give rap another go in 2004 but was never the same. The magic was gone. As Kanye put it on “Devil in a New Dress”: “Don’t leave while you’re hot, that’s how Mase screwed up.”But Mase’s legacy lives on in every rags-to-mega-riches story that’s become standard in rap; in the flows co-opted by everyone from Drake to Pusha T; in wannabe rap moguls naming their imprint after $200,000 luxury cars; in Jesus pieces as a rite of passage. So much of what rap has become can be traced back to those shiny suits blinged out in that wind tunnel. As Mase floats, an entire genre hangs in the balance.', ('Maxo Kream', 'Brandon Banks'): \"In a cheeky promo video released on Father’s Day, Maxo Kream’s dad explains the origin of his moniker Brandon Banks. “People could not pronounce Emekwanem,” he says, “I spent 18 hours a day explaining my name...so I changed it to Brandon Banks.” In this telling, which Emekwanem delivers with a jolly charisma, the handle is born from a comedy of errors: his name was hard on American ears, so Emekwanem made it easier.It turns out that’s the Disney version. In reality, Brandon Banks was Emekwanem’s criminal alias. Maxo knew Banks as the scammer whose grifts enriched and endangered his family in equal measure, and whose jail bids sowed the seeds for Maxo to later embrace street life. Sordid family history has long been the source of Maxo’s most resonant storytelling, and on Brandon Banks it becomes a superpower. As Maxo details the trials of his family, he’s energized by the parallels of their struggles, his bonds deepening as he claims his place within this complicated lineage.Maxo’s father serves as both a muse and foil, popping up throughout the record as both a character and a presence. Mirroring the album cover, a collage of their faces, Maxo builds stories around their points of overlap and distinction. His father’s scams aren’t laid out in detail, but their effects are felt in Maxo’s ties to street and gang life. “Bissonnet” breaks down the relationship between Emekwanem’s capers and Maxo’s thugging into direct cause-and-effect: “Police kicking in my door/Threw my mama on the floor/HPD took my pops/I bought a heat, hit the block.” When Maxo later gets kicked out by his mom, it feels like he’s following his dad’s lead.His dad shapes his thoughts in “Meet Again” as well. Written in the style of Nas’ “One Love” and interpolating Ice Cube’s “Steady Mobbin,’” the song is a letter to an imprisoned friend who has become a member of Maxo’s extended family in his father’s absence. Maxo addresses him as a brother: “Let me tell you ’bout your daughter/Yesterday she tried to walk/Everyday she getting smarter/Other day she tried to talk,” Maxo raps like a proud uncle. Because his dad and brother have been imprisoned before, he knows exactly what to write to keep his homie’s spirits up. As he moves from neighborhood gossip to personal news to lawyer updates, his casualness feels practiced. It’s touching and bleak.What prevents the record from becoming weepy and drab is Maxo’s pervasive sense of pride in himself and in his rapping. He has a dark sense of humor and a wry charm that, combined with his choppy flow and gruff voice, give his music a buoyancy. “Drizzy Draco” is a showy fusillade of gun bars that's as much about wordplay as always standing his ground. “Spice Ln.,” named after a street in his hometown of Alief, details capers with various levels of success, from a burglary in which the victim texts the robbers that they missed the money in the attic to a drug boost in which the victim later buys the drugs back. There are deaths on all sides and the gains are always meager, yet Maxo cherishes his life in full, the ups and the downs, the danger and the absurdity.On the record’s best songs, the action is the prelude to soul-searching. “8 Figures” is frank about the slipperiness of fast money, but then explodes into flexes. Maxo knows the smarter route, but he can’t deny that it just feels better to spend money than to save it. “Dairy Ashford Bastard,” another ode to an Alief street, is a tribute to and castigation of his dad. Pulling no punches, Maxo claims that Emekwanem was a cheater and domestic abuser in addition to being a convict. In the context of Emekwanem’s goofy interludes throughout the album, this revelation can feel like a reversal, but Maxo yokes these failures to his dad’s strengths, detailing his father’s overall commitment to his family and to Maxo. “I’m glad you spanked my ass/I’m glad that you my dad/And I’m thankful for yo ass,” he says with sincerity.The forgiveness Maxo offers his dad might feel overly generous or one-sided, given the omission of his mom’s perspective, but Maxo preaches loyalty as the bedrock of all relationships, so loving his dad is a matter of principle. While that sentiment sinks the Tupac-inspired “Brenda,” which feels like a rap adaptation of the Moynihan Report, the larger takeaway is that Maxo sees himself in Emekwanem (who he’s actually named after) and in his many real and adopted brothers. Like Punken before it, Brandon Banks is a major leap in craft and style as well as refinement of his self-image. As Maxo takes stock of the varied fates of his extended family he sees his own life with greater clarity.\", ('Big K.R.I.T.', 'K.R.I.T. IZ HERE'): 'Big K.R.I.T. has never had much interest in beef or drama, but early on his new record, he drops what could be interpreted as a jab at one of the famous headliners he’s shared shows with over the years. “You on the radio,” he raps, “They came to see me ’cause I did it without a hit.” It’s a brag, of course, but it’s a bit of a self-own, too. Even after nearly a decade on the industry’s radar, K.R.I.T. still doesn’t have anything even close to a hit, and it’s increasingly hard to imagine he ever will. He’s still working at more or less the same ceiling he was nearly a decade ago when his 2010 breakout mixtape K.R.I.T Wuz Here made him a critical favorite and a potential next-big-thing that never quite was.That’s not to minimize what he has accomplished. Unlike Donnis or Charles Hamilton and the blog-rap era’s other flash-in-the-pans, K.R.I.T. was able to parlay his talent into a sustainable recording career. Has a following, and longevity isn’t anything to scoff at. And yet there’s a sense that he’s underperformed. After 10 full-lengths, K.R.I.T. is beginning to look like rap’s answer to Ty Segall: consistently good, rarely stop-the-presses great. Even when his projects impress on first listen, they can’t help but bleed together in the big picture.And so K.R.I.T.’s latest project K.R.I.T. Iz Here captures K.R.I.T. the same as he always is: perfectly likable, admirably sincere, predictably dependable and dependably predictable. The album is ostensibly a sequel to his 2010 breakout project, and the title’s nod to the past only underscores how little his core sound has changed since then. He’s still making music seeped in UGK worship, all soulful Southern country grooves, subwoofer-Shiatsuing bass, and Pimp C snarl. There’s literally a song called “Learned From Texas,” about all the moves he learned from DJ Screw and UGK, as if anybody who’s listened to more than 10 minutes of K.R.I.T.’s music could have possibly overlooked Houston’s influence on him.But unlike 2017’s 4Eva Is a Mighty Long Time, where K.R.I.T. barely even bothered acknowledging current trends, on K.R.I.T. Iz Here he tries branching out a bit, too. “I Been Waitin,” with its posh, nervy production, borrows liberally from Travis Scott’s art-house trap. Opener “K.R.I.T. Here” taps the jazzy joy of Chance the Rapper and Donnie Trumpet. The Rico Love feature “Obvious” rides the same wave of wistful Caribbean music as Drake’s “Controlla,” while the strip-club fantasia “Blue Flame Ballet” mirrors the freak-soul of Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” There are shades of Migos in the triplet flows of the clubby trap cut “I Made,” and elements of Frank Ocean in the wistful closing stretch twofer of “High Beams” and “Life in the Sun.”All those songs are perfectly fine, because K.R.I.T. is almost incapable of making a song that’s anything less than perfectly fine. And yet maybe K.R.I.T. Iz Here might have been better off if K.R.I.T. had availed himself of a few swings and misses. On “Addiction,” a shameless and otherwise only so-so knockoff of Kanye West and Lil Pump’s “I Love It,” K.R.I.T. is joined by Lil Wayne, who drops one of those unexpectedly great verses that, even this far past his peak, he still delivers regularly enough that we should almost start expecting them. It’s funny and surprising, blasé yet vital. Wayne’s career, in many ways, has been the antithesis of K.R.I.T.’s. He’s hit higher heights than K.R.I.T. by a mile, yet he’s also face planted in ways it’s impossible to imagine K.R.I.T. would ever allow himself. Neither rapper’s approach is intrinsically right or wrong. But one sure is a lot more exciting.', ('Key!', 'SO EMOTIONAL'): 'Underground star Key! has a reputation as a rap trendsetter, championing talent like iLoveMakonnen, 21 Savage, and Playboi Carti early on in their careers. The 28-year-old is also known for his experimental and pioneering flows and adlibs, both delivered with insane ease. He was at his best on last year’s 777, his break-out collab with Kenny Beats. It’s an album that is a triumphant victory lap, navigating the unpredictable highs and lows encountered on his journey to adulthood. On the brief but substantial new release SO EMOTIONAL, he comfortably sticks to the fundamentals that have carried him through his career while leaning into a poppier pocket, and it works brilliantly.The ability to sound at home on virtually any beat or production style is core to Key!’s artistry. His gut-hitting, honest bars sound just as at home on the scrappy, melody-driven cuts of his days with cult Atlanta rap outfit Two-9 and early solo tapes, as he does on the sparse-sounding 2014 cuts that exposed him to larger audiences, like the OG Maco collaboration “U Guessed It” and his guest verse on Father’s “Look At Wrist.”On SO EMOTIONAL, the versatile rapper gets deep and let’s loose. A whirlwind, its eight tracks are super fun, as he raps through the extremes of romantic desire. By tapping a few different producers, he’s able to deftly hop in and out of different sonic realms in a tight space with signature ease.The playful and anthemic opener “MOTHERLESS CHILD”, which showcases him flexing the high reaches of his singing voice, would be a welcome and actually cool replacement for play at a major sports event, with its catchy and sing-a-long hook of “We want what we want/We want it now.” “WHY” laments a taunting lover while sounding like the surprise contender for radio-ready poolside-pop-punk hit of the summer. Produced by Key!’s longtime collaborator TrapMoneyBenny (who’s now best known as one of the producers of Drake’s “In My Feelings”), it highlights the growth and versatility of two of the foremost soundcrafters of the first Soundcloud rap era.The gloomy but urgent “YES OR NO” is an earnest pondering on where he and a love interest stand, that gets super real super fast, “I gotta love me/So I can love you.” Project stand-out “FALL HARD” is a banger reminiscent of an amusement park theme song on which an anguished Key! stretches words over cute video game-y synths to mirror the feeling of falling, and blasts the heart rate of the project up a notch. Through this track, produced by Philadelphia’s Oogie Mane of the quietly rising Working on Dying collective, and the spaced-out and spooky “HARD SOFT,” produced by Atlanta-via-Baltimore producer 14GOLDS, Key! reinforces that he’s still got his ear on the pulse of what sounds are bubbling.Ultimately, at 19 minutes, the project is a travel-sized highlight reel and re-affirmation of Key!’s versatility in this moment of his career, and is a blast to listen to all the way through. It’s the kind of tape that has you choosing a new favorite song every few listens. Over the years, Key! has earned the title of rap’s unsung hero, and with 777, was able to step into high gear to prove that he’s your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper for a reason. Through SO EMOTIONAL, he solidifies he’s still tapped into that energy creatively and is continuing to innovate and set new blueprints for all that popular rap can be today. And by simultaneously communicating the distinct highs and lows of love so viscerally, he created one of the best summer love/summer heartbreak soundtracks of the year.', ('Jaden Smith', 'ERYS'): 'Last spring it was announced that Jaden Smith will play an “alternate reality version” of Kanye West on an upcoming TV series. He won’t have to study much for the role. The rapper, designer, and Twitter theoretician has been closely following in the Chicago MC’s footsteps for years, adopting both his creative bravado—he recently stated that his fashion icons are Pharrell, Batman, and the Greek god Poseidon—and bombastic style of conceptual thinking.This creative mode has inspired the 21-year-old to take on some notably big-hearted projects, including a vegan food truck catered toward the less fortunate in downtown Los Angeles and a paper-carton water company that’s reportedly helping the dire situation in Flint, Michigan. It also led to a debut album that was hugely ambitious in sound and scope (Smith cited 2016’s The Life of Pablo as its primary inspiration) but failed to show any potential beyond its shiny production value. ERYS, his newest, is even grander, a galaxy of beat switch-ups, vocal effects, and genre mash-ups that drown his voice in a soupy sonic mixture.A huge chunk of the project is devoted to Jaden doing everything he can to alter his voice, drenching it in staticky reverb, pitching it down a handful of octaves, or layering it underneath the harmonizing of guest vocalists. When it is distinguishable, it’s stiff and empty, used to deliver stale references like, “Star Wars with the clique, I’m Han Solo with the rips/Kobe with the pass, had to hit it no assist.” It gets even cheesier on the flimsy trap anthem “Mission,” where he fires off a limp diss at XXL Magazine’s annual “Freshman Class” by rapping, “Man, they look at me and know that I’m the freshest,” a gee-whiz boast that could have been ripped from one of his dad’s albums in the ’80s.Things get worse when he tries to mask his flaws as an MC by overcooking the production. Unlike fellow Kanye disciples Tyler, the Creator and Travis Scott, Smith doesn’t practice balance in his curation; he mashes together his favorite artists’ sounds in the hopes of stumbling upon symmetry. The first four tracks aim to capture the goosebumps of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy but instead form a grating mass of Auto-Tuned bridges, piano build-ups, and big drum fills that never arrive at a climax. Not much later, on the backend of “Again,” he imitates the soft guitars, pitch-altered vocals, and sparse drums of Frank Ocean’s Blonde but fails to capture any of the work’s intimacy. Meanwhile, his collab with Kid Cudi, “On My Own,” with its boilerplate organs and stomping kicks, sounds like a Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven leftover.Smith fairs better when he stops trying to recreate the revolutionary work of his idols and lowers the stakes. The loosest track on the album, “Summertime In Paris,” which features his sister Willow, is also its most successful: a breezy, guitar-driven tune that gets by on simplicity rather than grandiosity. “Summertime is meant to fall in love, I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes/We’ll dance all night,” Smith hums warmly on the chorus. Willow joins him on the second verse as the two siblings revel in their nostalgia. Not even a clunker of a line by Jaden tarnishes the endearing moment. While nothing about “Summertime” is groundbreaking, at least it sounds fun.Beyond a few other fleeting moments of experimentalism on ERYS—the second half of “K,” when the buzzing of an electric razor slowly morphs into a heaving trap beat, or “Fire Dept,” a decent ode to the fast and distorted energy of SoCal punk—it’s mostly a slog, the sound of an artist with a blurry vision and too many resources at his disposal. In an interview a day after its release, Smith stated that he wanted ERYS “to change the world”; in reality, it’s the least memorable thing he’s done this year.', ('Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire', 'Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire'): '“Huzzah!” This was the triumphant cry Mr. Muthafuckin\\' eXquire rode to viral success in 2011. The Brooklyn-raised rapper broke through with an outlandish attitude and fluid flow, bragging about downing half a gallon of budget vodka over an eerily funky beat sourced from underground gore master Necro. A remix to “Huzzah!” roped in Das Racist, Despot, Danny Brown, and El-P, boosting eXquire’s profile even further. He signed to Universal records. The major label platform didn’t work out for the uncompromisingly creative rapper—pretty much to no one’s surprise. As he rhymed after leaving the label, “When I came, niggas said I was just 40s and orgies/Took all the deep shit I rhymed about and ignored it... My stupid ass sold his soul and didn\\'t even get the fame—I ain\\'t even fuck Rihanna.” Eight years later, eXquire finds himself back where he started, self-releasing music entirely on his own terms via his Chocolate Rabbit enterprise. The move feels full circle, like the welcome reclaiming of his soul.eXquire\\'s self-titled album starts in fiery fashion with “FCK Boy!” Over a lo-fi track that sounds like a no-budget Italian horror movie blasting from a dying television, eXquire gets right to the rabble-rousing: “R. Kelly can rot in hell, but his music too good to mute/Oops!/Telling me no more ‘Ignition’ while I\\'m dancing/But then I\\'m ‘posed to stand for the fucking national anthem?\" Next, he’s alluding to reparations and a \"Gucci fabric noose” and adding, \"Fuck Prada, Burberry, fuck Louis Vuitton too/They ain’t do nothing racist but that\\'s just in case they do.”The tirade is eXquire in capsule form, erudite and profane, delivering pop culture and politics in a spellbinding, seamless flow. As much as he channels no-fucks-given icons of bygone eras like Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Eazy-E, and Willie D—and Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire gleefully hits Efil4zaggin levels of expletives—his lyrics have always offered savvy political commentary and catharsis for those prepared to hear it. On the slinky piano of “Nosediiive,” eXquire namechecks Abbie Hoffman and updates his philosophies for a world of surveillance capitalism, where corporations are “pulling our privacy from under our feet.” “SpankBang favorites and Amazon wish lists/Algorithm trigger words, they put me on their hit list,” he raps.Balancing the politics are eXquire’s reflections on self-doubt and depression. On “RumbleFish,” over a hazy funk beat by long-time foil CONSTROBUZ, eXquire flashes back to being a 12-year-old kid in the projects, retreating behind comic book fantasies and watching his mom in a physically abusive relationship with a man who’d go on to kill his next girlfriend. Despite the heavy subject matter, eXquire’s sing-song flow and the track’s nostalgic glow make it redolent of Slick Rick’s “Hey Young World”—it’s genuinely tender and moving. Naturally, eXquire follows it with the unapologetically coarse “I Love Hoes,” which expresses exactly what its title promises. But that’s always been the real draw with eXquire: He’s a complicated and multi-faceted artist who defies pigeonholing. He conveys this sentiment on the hook to \"RumbleFish\" in pleading terms, where he repeats, “Don\\'t box me in, don\\'t box me in.” It might not be as catchy as “Huzzah,” but it feels twice as heartfelt.', ('J Balvin', 'OASIS'): \"As Alejandro “Sky” Ramirez wrote J Balvin’s verse on “Un Peso”—a standout on his new collaborative album with Puerto Rico’s Bad Bunny—the Colombian musician recalled an old song from the Argentinian rock band Los Enanitos Verdes that his family used to drink and party to back in his hometown of Medellín. Their 1994 hit “Lamento Boliviano” was drenched in self-medication and singer/bassist Marciano Cantero’s romantic pathos offered the kind of lyrics that get screamed back at you when sung to packed stadiums: “Y yo estoy aquí, borracho y loco (And here I am, drunk and crazy)/Y mi corazón idiota, siempre brillará” (And my idiot heart, always shining). For J Balvin, Sky flipped part of the original hook to turn Balvin from the heartbroken to the heartbreaker: “Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará” (“And your idiot heart will always miss me”). Over the course of a single day, what began as a half-serious gag—what if we got Cantero in the booth?—ended with a phone call from the Argentine asking for stems. “It was kind of a joke in the studio,” Sky told Rolling Stone. “But they take the jokes very seriously.”“Un Peso” captures the appeal of Oasis; frothy music made by serious talents. The reigning princes of urbano spend much of the album’s 31-minute runtime promoting tropical hedonist pursuits: too-tiny bikinis, excessive alcohol consumption, ostentatious displays of wealth, and unprotected sex. They bro down over dembow beats and pack as many dancing women as possible into their music videos. It’s goofy, but incredibly fun—a soundtrack for beach BBQs and ad hoc fire-hydrant water parks, summer vibes made manifest.The risk of not taking yourself too seriously is that plenty of the lyrics reveal themselves to be cringe-worthy upon close inspection—“Voy pa’ adentro como Pelé (¡Gol!),” or, “I’m going inside you like Pelé (Goal!),” Balvin sings on “Mojaita”—and much of the record can best be described as ’manos being ’manos. When Bad Bunny sings lines like “Ese booty es un paraíso como Bora Bora” (“The booty is a paradise like Bora Bora”), you can almost hear him smirk. It’s par for the course for the handful of the duo’s pre-Oasis collaborations, and whether you find this charming or gross likely hinges on your capacity for the crassness prevalent in much of urban music of any language.Of the two stars, it’s the 25-year-old Bad Bunny whose voice looms largest on Oasis. His nasal Auto-Tune croon christens every song he appears on, regardless of the style he’s working with. The 34-year-old Balvin, ever the chameleonic wave-rider, is more content to go with the flow. Balvin verses can often feel like guest features on his own records—look no further than Beyoncé’s star turn on the “Mi Gente” remix—or as in the case of “Un Peso,” are sometimes written by someone else.To be fair, few can do the sadboi vibes quite like el conejo malo. Bad Bunny has mastered the moody lament, soundtracking the comedown from the club in addition to the perreo anthems. The latest example is Oasis standout “La Cancion,” a jazzy, romantic ode that slows down the classic dembow riddim and showcases a lonely trumpet reverberating within the arrangement’s ample negative space—a production choice directed by Bad Bunny himself. It’s reggaetón, it’s romantic, and it’s jazzy, combining familiar elements into something fresh and new.Most of the production is handled by Sky and his mentor Marco “Tainy” Masís, the legendary Puerto Rican reggaetón producer who helmed much of Bad Bunny’s phenomenal X100PRE and J Balvin’s Vibras. The production crew seamlessly weave together acoustic elements (“Yo Le Llego”’s upright bass, “Un Peso”’s ukulele, “La Cancion”’s trumpet), trap-style synthesizers, and dembow beats into a coherent pan-Latin aesthetic. This is the sound of the new urbano latino.Bunny and Balvin even tip their cap to Africa—the original source of nearly all the sounds miscegenating on Oasis—tapping Nigerian Afrobeat all-star Mr. Eazi for “Como Un Bebé,” their take on a “Banku” bop, the smoothed-out signature style Eazi named after the heavy Ghanian comfort food. It’s a fitting end to a record devoted to celebrating good times, a healing balm providing temporary relief from the violence and oppression that they’ve addressed in their communities. When Bad Bunny implores us to “Baila pa' mí” (“Dance with me”), we comply, powerless to resist.\", ('Freddie Gibbs', 'Bandana'): 'On paper, Freddie Gibbs, a straight-shooting street rapper, and Madlib, an eccentric tinkerer, are as mouth-watering a combo as licorice and pickle juice. But their collaborative 2014 album Piñata succeeded because the two are equally uncompromising: Madlib tailors beats to his eclectic ears alone, while Gibbs insists that he can rap over anything. Kindred spirits, the pair bonded through mutual gumption.On follow-up Bandana, the bond deepens. Madlib’s beats remain off-kilter, and Gibbs remains gangster, but there’s a looser feel to this record, a spirit of intuition and intimacy. Their overall recording process didn’t change much: Madlib sent beats and Gibbs rapped over them as is—samples, pauses, breaks, and all. This time, though, they made the effort to meet in the studio and review different mixes and edits, to calibrate. The result is a keener sense of each other’s presence. Moving in lockstep, Gibbs and Madlib pull themselves deeper into one another’s worlds, forging a new one in the process.On Piñata, the duo bridged Gibbs’ street sense and Madlib’s throwback flair by embracing the sounds and attitudes of blaxploitation. Smoky soul drifted out of every crevice, drugs flooded the streets, and middle fingers never came down. The general vibe was defiant, gritty, and nostalgic, fitting the back-to-basics spirit of a proud lyricist linking with an inveterate crate-digger. Bandana is palpably more unhinged, less rooted in a particular time or style or mood.The through line is black freedom. Across the record Gibbs mentions various black figures and tragedies, from the transatlantic slave trade (“Flat Tummy Tea”) to Baltimore drug kingpin Melvin Williams (“Education”) to basketball star Allen Iverson (“Practice”) to the death by police bombing of mass shooter Micah Johnson (“Soul Right”) to Tupac’s assault on the Hughes Brothers (“Massage Seats”), weaving a grand, ambiguous tapestry. Gibbs has been talking black power in various forms since his early mixtapes, but here he’s less certain about what it looks like, who embodies it, how to secure it. As he takes a fuller view of his life and the fates of his idols, he grows more cautious. “I can’t move the same/I gotta readjust how I maneuver,” he insists on “Gat Damn.”He’s kept on his toes by Madlib’s strikingly robust production, which is maximal compared to his revered lo-fi sound. “Half Manne Half Cocaine” begins with ticking hi-hats and bass kicks topped by twinkly bells, then spazzes into a torrent of cymbals and sampled shouts—trap by way of EPMD. The scuzzy riff on “Flat Tummy Tea” is stretched, distorted, and splashed with atonal effects that evaporate into a breakbeat. Madlib has always been an unsparing producer, but this is one of the few times he’s allowed himself to be baroque.Gibbs’ rapping is just as fitful. Jerky yet nimble, he regularly drops in and out of cadence, throttling and braking his flows to accent key images. On “Situations,” he mentions surviving a shooting that claimed his cousin, sprinting through the memory like he’s felt a sudden jolt of pain. “Cousin took two to the brain/Bullets missed me it’s a blessing/I could see the day like it was yesterday I’ll never forget it,” he says, cramming the last line into one bar. On “Gat Damn,” he recalls fasting in an Austrian prison that didn’t provide Muslim-friendly meals. “Say my prayers, Alhamduillah/No bacon, ham, bacon, ham/And cold salami/That’s all they serving,” he sings, evoking the strain of the experience by spacing out his words. Gibbs boasts often of his versatility, but here his movement is dictated by purpose rather than reflex.A current of self-discovery bubbles beneath all this motion. Madlib emerges as less subdued, more emboldened to challenge his collaborator (and the listener) rather than shroud his ideas in fog. His catalog is full of gems, but not since Georgia Anne Muldrow’s Seeds, and Madvillainy before that, has the Beat Konducta felt like, well, a conductor, actively dictating the path the music takes. You can feel Gibbs’ ideas being guided by the dreamy loops on “Crime Pays” and the humid sway of “Cataracts.”The album’s few misfires occur when guests misread the room. Continuing his one-man nostalgia show, Anderson .Paak’s bloodless crooning on “Giannis” is pure pastiche. “Power, love, and loyalty,” he reads from a movie poster. Pusha T and Killer Mike’s appearances on “Palmolive” are stiff compared to Gibbs’ constant action. They treat the song’s beautiful main loop like a fossil in a museum, admiring it from afar. Black Thought and Yasiin Bey are the only ones who seem to share Gibbs’ hunger here.Overcoming the constraints on black freedom was always the underlying mission of Madlib’s beloved jazz and soul artists, as well as Gibbs’ prized black rebels. For Bandana, the pair taps into that heritage and allow themselves to be shaped by its highs and lows, its heroes and villains. Finding themselves within that slipstream of black thought and life, they plot their course on their terms. Bandana is tradition and transgression: one rapper, one producer, no limitations.'}\n"
